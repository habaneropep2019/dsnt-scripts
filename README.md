# dsnt-scripts

dsnt-scripts is a collection of tools for building a Dissonant system, and creating packages. They are known to work correctly on an openSuSE Tumbleweed system. They should also work on a Dissonnat system. All other systems, user beware. IMPORTANT NOTE: This has not been tested on any systems as of 2021. A lot has changed in three years time. Use at your own risk.

CODE RELICENSING NOTIFICATION:

Most code in this repository is currently licensed under one or more versions of the GPL. All code will be relicensed to a BSD 3-clause license. This notice does not serve as the actual relicensing. This message will be changed when the relicensing has been completed. You will be free to use previous versions under their old license. All new versions will be uniformly licensed under a BSD 3-clause license.

Be aware that using dash as your shell could cause your system to crash and burn. Most of these scripts check for the correct BASH version (version 4 or greater), and will fail that check if you are using DASH.
Always use bash!

Some utilities may be configured differently on other systems, so when in doubt, assume that dsnt-scripts will use the GNU
usage of a command.
