# dsnt-scripts

dsnt-scripts is a collection of tools for building a Dissonant system, and creating packages. They are known to work correctly on an openSuSE Tumbleweed system. They should also work on a Dissonnat system. All other systems, user beware.

Be aware that using dash as your shell could cause your system to crash and burn. Most of these scripts check for the correct BASH version (version 4 or greater), and will fail that check if you are using DASH.
Always use bash!

Some utilities may be configured differently on other systems, so when in doubt, assume that dsnt-scripts will use the GNU
usage of a command.
